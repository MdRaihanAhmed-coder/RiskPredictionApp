# RiskPredictionApp - Code still not uploaded
My undergraduate thesis involved designing a risk prediction software to predict ovarian and cervical cancer in relation to stress. I had the opportunity to work on bioinformatics, data mining techniques, and I applied machine learning algorithms to reach my goal. Finally, I invented an app for risk prediction.
